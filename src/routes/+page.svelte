Welcome!

<p>
	I don't blog often, but when I do, it's because I've found or created something that I think is
	truly unique and worth sharing. It might be a code snippet, a technique, or a perspective that I
	haven't seen anywhere else.
</p>

<p>
	If you like something here or found it useful, please share it with others. You can find me on <a
		href="https://github.com/rrmistry">GitHub</a
	>.

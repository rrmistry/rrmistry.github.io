Hello there! I’m a seasoned cloud architect and software engineer, with a strong foothold in the insurance tech domain. Over the last decade, I’ve been orchestrating digital clouds that drive business solutions across diverse landscapes. My journey has been about more than just coding; it’s about fostering scalable, cost-effective solutions that add value and propel organizations forward.

In the ever-evolving tech realm, I find my passion ignited in the world of containerized applications and cloud-native software development. The allure of crafting and deploying multi-cloud implementations that hold the promise of scalability and efficiency has been an exhilarating experience. Through this, I have had the pleasure of saving millions for businesses, enhancing infrastructural capacities, and automating manual workloads to free up creativity and innovation.

Being a fervent advocate for technology, I ventured into the entrepreneurial landscape with Righteous AI Inc., where consulting became my forte. Here, I blended data science, engineering, and automation to fabricate cloud-based solutions. This venture was not only about delivering projects but about embarking on a learning expedition, understanding the varied needs of industries, and tailoring solutions that resonate with their core objectives.

Aside from being a techie, I am a physics enthusiast with a degree from the University of Waterloo. The laws of physics not only resonate in the natural world but are analogous to the digital realm as well, where I apply the principles of efficiency, scalability, and sustainability.

I’ve called Canada my home, but as I migrate to New Zealand under a working holiday visa, I am on the lookout for a full-time role that not only aligns with my professional aspirations but also emphasizes mental well-being. I seek to contribute to a team where shared goals and values are at the helm, where every project is a step towards cutting-edge solutions and where continuous learning is the culture.

In my quest for a new chapter, I am excited about the endless possibilities, the new challenges, and the chance to contribute to something impactful. So, whether you’re looking for a cloud architect to bolster your team or just want to geek out over the latest in cloud tech, I’d love to connect!
